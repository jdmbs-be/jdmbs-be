### Hi there! 👨‍💻 👋

I'm here to share the exciting journey of Timefold's evolution from OptaPlanner. As a marketer, I'm passionate about making complex optimization accessible to developers.
### About Timefold (formerly OptaPlanner)
You might remember OptaPlanner, a metaheuristics constraints-based solver, started by [Ge0ffrey](https://github.com/ge0ffrey) and matured under the wings of Red Hat. Geoffrey De Smet and the original OptaPlanner team are now continuing the project as [Timefold](https://github.com/TimefoldAI/timefold-solver). Why OptaPlanner continues as Timefold can be read in our fork message on [our blog](https://timefold.ai/blog/2023/optaplanner-fork).
Timefold is an open source AI solver to optimize operations and scheduling in Java. Used to optimize Vehicle Routing, Employee scheduling, Order Picking Scheduling, Last-mile-delivery routing, Production Line Scheduling, and much more.
Our [Timefold Solver repo](https://github.com/TimefoldAI/timefold-solver) and [Quickstarts](https://github.com/TimefoldAI/timefold-quickstarts) repos are here to help developers like you solve intricate planning puzzles. From route optimization to shift scheduling, we're dedicated to empowering you to build smarter, more optimized software.
🌟 Thanks in advance for starring the [Timefold Solver repo](https://github.com/TimefoldAI/timefold-solver).
